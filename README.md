## About

- 👋 Hi, I’m Amarjot Sandhu. A prospective Computer Enineering Student and SDSU.
- 💞️ I am actively collaborating with my team to design and develop a Smart Notification System for Appliances that originally did not have that functionality.
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in learning backend development, and deploying my own webapps.
- 👀 Fun fact: I am really looking forward to "The Fall Off" Album.
